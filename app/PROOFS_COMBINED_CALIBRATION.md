# Combined Calibration Proofs
This document contains formal proofs for the derived equations that calculate the combined 
calibration coefficients. 

These coefficients are necessary since the data sampled for calibration
was likely already calibrated, unless the calibration was zeroed out first. The combined coefficients
account for this and allow the new calibration to be applied on top of the old one.
